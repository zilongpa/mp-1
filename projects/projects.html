                            As a vice president of the BUCSSA Technology Department, developed and
                            maintained a website with features including freshman orientation,
                            event registration, accounting and sponsorship management, and
                            real-time high-concurrency voting.

                        <li>
                            The main development was done using Flask and React, with SASS as
                            the CSS preprocessor. The high-concurrency components were
                            developed using Rust and the Tokio multi-threading framework,
                            while AWS MySQL was used for the database.
